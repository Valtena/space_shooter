# Space Shooter
A simple 2D space-shooter game that demonstrates how to make a game using the [Amethyst](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst) game engine.

This is a simple space-shooter game where you manipulate your space ship using right and left thrusters (A and D) and fire lasers
(spacebar) to destroy the falling asteroids. If you get hit by three asteroids--game over!

It demonstrates some common game-design patterns in Component Object Programming (COP), also known as Entity Component Systems (ECS).

It is fully documented, so you can use it as a learning resource.
